C Library for SHT1x sensors connected to bcm2835 via GPIO ports


This software is a slightly-tweaked copy of the "Raspberry Pi SHT1x 
communication library" written by John Burns (www.john.geek.nz), which is 
itself a derivative work of the "Nice Guy SHT11 library" written by Daesung 
Kim.

Daesung's work is not licensed, but John's work is licensed under CC BY-SA v3.0
and so this software is licensed by me, John Ruiz, under CC BY-SA v3.0.
